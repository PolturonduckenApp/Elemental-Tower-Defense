This mobile app is being build and tested to practice programming skills and build up further knowledge of useful tools to use when 
building a mobile app. 

The game being built is meant to be a "tower defense" game: enemies advance down a pathway in hopes of reaching the end and the user's
goal is to destroy those enemies -- through the use of defense towers -- before they get there.
